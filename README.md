# jklm-bombparty-bot

This is a basic jklm bombparty bot that automatically types the words for you.

This can be immensely improved.

1. Compile the websocket host files
2. Once compiled run the server
3. Execute the javascript in your game console.
4. Profit

I will be linking the compiled server btw.
